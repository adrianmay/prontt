INSTALLATION
============

First you need SWI prolog working. 
I never tried this on Windows or Mac, 
so if you know how to do that 
please tell me and I'll edit these instructions.

On linux, the packages and binary tarballs all seem broken. 
You have to build from source.

Clone the stable git repo, 
DON'T do ./configure, rather, 
copy build.tmpl to build and edit it to cut out xpce, 
then run it. 
After that, try make check (don't expect perfection) 
and sudo make install. 

If you get a prompt for swipl you're getting somewhere.

If you cloned this repo and cd-ed there, 
type make and point your browser at localhost:8888.

If it doesn't work for any reason 
(which would not be reason to doubt the laws of physics), 
please file an issue at the github issue tracker.
